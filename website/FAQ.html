<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq1"> How can I bet in the smart pool lottery ?</div></span><br>

  ->> You can bet directly in the smart contract using a get js library: [follow this steps]<br><br>

  ->> You can use an intermediary website with Metamask or Mist such as: [website list here]
      <br><br>
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq5"> How is your lottery working ?</div></span> <br><br>

  ->> The lottery manager (the smart contract) create lottery pool. Each pool as its own parameters: max ticket and max time. When the pool is full or the maximum time is reach, the lottery manager randomly choose one ticket inside the pool, this ticket is the winner. This ticket is linked to the betting ETH address. This address automatically received fund from the contract.<br>
    The john M pool is set without maximum amount it is run every 57600 block (around 10days).<br>
    A new pool is created every time one is ended.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq25"> Do I need an account ?</div></span> <br><br>

  ->> NO accounts. NO deposits. Your sending address is your account.
    </li>

    <br>
    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq2"> Can I buy ticket for some one else ?</div></span> <br>

  ->> No you cannot ! As explain above in the warning section, Winning funds are always delivered at the address you bet with and only this address, their is no way to change this. This is to provide security and make sure no one can hack your funds.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq3"> Why have you create this lottery ?</div></span><br>


  ->> We are a team of Ethereum and blockchains enthusiasts. We do live in a country where law is very strict and very restrictive, in our birth country people are not allowed to play game involving money. We do believe blockchain can change this, as no country can censor blockchain. <br>
  We do believe blockchain will help people free them-self against any entity like government and bad regulation trying to impose to others some shit rules (they often don't respect them-self). We hope doing this smart contract will help some people getting free from tyranny government rules.
      <br><br>
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq26"> Have you plan an ICO ?</div></span><br>


  ->> We may do an ICO, token have already been created. We will do an ICO only if enough people are interested by it. The smart contract is already up and running, but we could use an ICO in order to do marketing around this lottery as well as invovled some token owner in this project. If you would be interested by an ICO let us know by commenting in bitcointalk. You can also give us your email ((here)). To know more about the token go to the next question.
    <br><br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq27"> What are SPLT token ?</div></span><br>


  ->> SPLT: Smart Pool Lottery Token give you the right to receive your share from the 1% fees of all ETH amount bet inside all pools. The token contract splits fees between all token owners. If you are interested about owning some of them, please let us know by commenting in bitcointalk. You can also give us your email ((here)) in order to be notified if we do an ICO.
    <br><br>
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>

<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq4"> What's happen if i put to much eth ?</div></span> <br>

  ->> Don't worry if you put to much ETH the remain will be automatically refund to the sending ETH address.
    <br><br>
    </li>

    <br>
    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq6"> What are backend functions ? </div></span><br><br>

Anyone can use the "backend" contract functions but it cost gas, you don't need to do it as we get a bot running 24/7 to use those functions when they needed.
  <br>
  The backend functions are:<br>
  ->> End a lottery and launch new pool: only if max time amount or max ticket amount is reach.<br>
  ->> Draw the winner: only if a lottery is ended and 240 blocks had past<br>
    </li>
    <br>

  For max amount pool: number of tickets you own divided by the total number of tickets available.
  <br>
  For the john M pool: number of tickets you own divided by the total number of tickets sold at the end of the timed period you play with.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
<span class='Pinfo'><div id="faq10"> How the winner is chosen ? </div></span><br><br>
